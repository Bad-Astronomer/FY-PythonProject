Project Description:
Password Manager is a simple but very handy tool to generate strong random passwords with a user defined criteria and store them in an encrypted hidden file. It will be only accessible if master username and password is entered correctly. 

Problem Statement: 
One of our common friend's account got hacked recently. After having a conversation with him, we got to know his password was quite simple in nature with only a few different characters. And so, we got the idea to make a random password generator which will help people make strong passwords. Since the generated passwords are completely random and cannot be memorized, we thought of building a password manager which can encrypt and save your passwords and is secured by a master login.
